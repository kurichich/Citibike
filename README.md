# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
- During a vacation to New York City, bikes were used as transportation to tour the city.  This analysis will investigate how the bike share business actually works in NYC.  This will be used to create a proposal for how it might work in Des Moines.
- Part of the data that was extracted and used for analysis contained a date format that needed to be transformed in Pandas to a usable datatype for visualizations in Tableau.

## Results

- Checkout Times for Users: The most common checkout times were within a twenty minute time duration.  After forty five minutes, only a fraction of the bikes were still checked out.

- Checkout times by Gender: Males were clearly the largest user of bikes checked out within the first 30 to 45 minutes.   After that, the genders were relatively equal for trip duration.

-  Trips by Weekday per Hour: The busiest time for bike rentals was betwen 5:00 to 7:00pm on Thursdays.  Heavy usage also occurred on Monday, Tuesday and Friday for the same time frame, as well as every weekday from 8:00 to 9:00am.

- User Trips by Gender by Weekday: Male subscribers created the highest demand during the week, followed by female subscribers for the same period.  Unsubscribed customers created the most demand on Saturdays and Sundays.

- Peak Demand Times in August:  Since August was identified as the busiest summer month to select a sample size, the peak hours were during popular commute times, before and after a normal workday.



## Summary
### Using data analytics and Tableau, there are several highlights from the NYC Bikeshare Program that can help establish a similar program elsewhere:
  1. Subscribers were the majority of bike users during peak commute times, creating a predictable and consistent base of users.
  2. The duration of most bike rentals was 10 to 30 minutes in length.
  3. Males comprised the highest usage by gender.
  4. The highest concentration of destinations were in the congested areas of NYC.

### A couple of suggestions for additional analysis:
  1. The duration of bike trips on the weekends in August, relative to the starting and ending destinations.
  2. 
  3.
